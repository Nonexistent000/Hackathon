# Demo App

This project is a program that attempts to teach, hone, and perfect the user's ability to evaluate common Math operations such as multiplication, division, subtraction, addition, square roots, etc. The user chooses which operation they want to practice, and the program choses from a pool of questions to give the user stuff to practice. I did this as I recognize Math as one of my favorite subjects and want to share the knowledge of math with other people. 

## How to Use

You download the files and press Run. From there on, the steps are easy enough that you can follow from the program.

## How it Works

It is made possible by Java swing and JFrame. 

### Technology

Java was used as well as the knowledge from the information about `[LayoutManagers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html#gridbag)`.

### File Structure

For now, the file strucutre consists of three files that each pop up a separate JFrame for the user to read. When finished, the file strucutre would include packages containing multiplication, addition, division, etc. that the LearnGui file could access and display for the user to do.

### Problems

One of them was making the buttons switch from a BorderLayout to a GridBoxLayout and invoke separate JFrames from a single one. I have never worked with JFrames before and research on the internet while a bit of tinkering on my own allowed me to overcome these problems. 

## Other (optional)

This has other stuff that you want to tell us. This entire section is optional.

### Issues

Right now, the program doesn't have any problems for the user to practice. That is all in concept right now. The only thing the program does is show the menu file and show two more JFrames once invoked.

### Future Improvements

If I had unlimited time, I would work on finishing this project and adding a bunch of questions and packages. Apart from that, I would also create a Starter Series type of project where I would also create similar types of programs for English, Science, and other subjects. This would allow all general knowledge to be at the hands of anyone who has a smartphone, simply extending and promoting the idea of education.
